          example: Competitive or recreational team sport, football opposes two teams on a vast rectangular grassy field. By alternating between the defensive and the offensive position, you will have to carry the oval ball or to throw it to reach, with your team, the opposing teamâ€™s end zone. Hopefully, no one will block your game and your run. Hut! Hut! Hut!
